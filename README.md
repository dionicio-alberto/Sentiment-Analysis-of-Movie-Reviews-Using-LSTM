## Introduction

Nutural lenguage processing is a subfield in artificial intelligence that is concerned with the interaction of computers and human lenguages.

With the proliferation of deep learning and neural networks in the image classification domian, scientists began to wonder whether the powers of neural networks could be applied to NLP.

Sentiment analysis is also an area of NLP that benefited from the resurgence of deep learning. Sentiment analysis is defined as the prediction of the positivity of a text. Most sentiment analysis problems are classification problems (positive/neutral/negative) and not regression problems.

In this repository we've created a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for Sentiment Analysis of movies reviews from IMDb 

**All project is in the folder *Notebook*.**

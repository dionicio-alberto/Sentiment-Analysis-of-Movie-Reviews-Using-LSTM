## Introduction

Computer vision is an engineering discipline focused on developing software that can derive significance from visual data. As per a popular anecdote, computer vision's origins can be traced back to the 1960s when Professor Marvin Minsky of MIT tasked a team of undergraduate students with an intriguing summer project. The challenge presented to them was to affix a camera to a computer and enable the computer to articulate its observations of the surroundings.

In this repository we've created a Convolutional Neural Network to identify Cats or Dogs. Here, we created two models, the first model was created from 0, using Keras librery. In the second model, we created a pre-trained model using transfer learning from VGC16 model

**All project is in the folder *Notebook*.**

## Features

Principal's model feactures:

- 2 models trained
- ~80 % and ~90% accuracity
- Model 1: 2 convolutional-max pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers.
- Model 2: transfer learning to leverage on the pretrained VGG16 network for our classification
